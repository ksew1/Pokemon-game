## To start run Main class
### If you want to enjoy game without difficulty you can turn god mode by going to the hero class and switching boolean variable godMode to true. You will play as normaly not playable pokemon with high base stats 
## Fight system:
Fight system had small adjustments to make it more interesting. Now u have 3 different attacks with different damages. 
But with increasing damage also miss chance increases

Type system multiplication  is written in Main class or Type enum under damageTo method
